    <p> Although there are many people on our little planet, even with celebrities amidst the masses, there is one particular member of society who always seem to leave people ever so speechless. And that person is none other than Delaney Moua, a young student of our era who always manages to surprise everyone in her path. Those who vaguely know her recall her unexpected charisma, but those who take a closer look always find something more! From the shocking movie night in which she placed a full popcorn package (plastic covering included) into a microwave, nearly causing a fire within her dorm houseâ€”to her significant innovation, using a mass of astronomic and quantum physics and technology to push past the universal bounds of 24 hours in a day and extending it to 30!
